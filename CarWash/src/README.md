# The Car Wash project

This is a cool project where you get to implement an interface, and then use that implementation in a realistic simulation that you also have to produce! There is quite a bit of coding to be done, though.

First, you are given a simple interface, `Q.java` (where is it? Look above!)

Interface Q contains six methods. Any class that implements this interface must implement all its methods, in addition to any other methods you may wish to include there (e.g., a `main()` for testing purposes).
